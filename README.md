# presentations
Repository to put some of the presentations I've made on various topics.

Basically I do presentations using jupyter notebooks, which results in 
slides in HTML with JS in it, using [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com).

Basically you take a jupyter notebook with .ipynb extension and produce
an HTML file with the slides with the following command:

```bash
jupyter nbconvert notebook.ipynb --to slides --post serve
```

Changing the name of the notebook, of course.

# Alternatives in physics

Presentation first showed in April 2018 in the seminar of the research
group in Simulation of Physical Systems at Universidad Nacional de 
Colombia. This presentation was basically to show what a computational
physicist (or something similar) like me does in industry and for fun,
mostly outside academia.

While talking about this the idea is to introduce some concepts in
computation related to literate computing and how this can benefit 
academic research in terms of reproducibility and outreach of the work
done.
